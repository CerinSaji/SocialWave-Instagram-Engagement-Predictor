engage with their audiences. SocialWave focuses on the development of a tool designed
to enhance content strategy for Instagram. The core functionality includes predicting the
engagement rate of posts based on images and hashtags and generating optimized cap-
tions as well as recommending valid hashtags either through user prompts or automated
image analysis. The project employs robust machine learning techniques, integrating al-
gorithms for engagement prediction and image analysis. Caption generation and hashtag
recommendation are facilitated by transformer models, enabling seamless text generation
based on visual content and user input. The primary advantage is that it follows a holistic
approach in empowering users to create more impactful posts and consequently increase
their potential for virality. The combination of advanced machine learning algorithms
and deep learning techniques ensures high accuracy and adaptability to evolving social
